Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

Conclusion :

Random forest giving best accuracy with Randomized Search Cv i.e. r-square : 0.91 . Highest rented bike count is at 8am & 6pm .Demand for rented bikes increases in summer season and drops in winter.Functioning day has high demand of rented bikes over non functioning day indicates people using bike for travelling for work/office. Good growth in demand of rented bike count in year 2018.
- *Data Collection:* Gathering historical rental data including timestamps, bike availability, and environmental factors (e.g., weather, holidays).
- *Data Preprocessing:* Cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis. This includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Analyzing patterns and correlations within the dataset to gain insights into bike usage trends over different time periods (hourly, daily, weekly).
- *Feature Selection:* Identifying key features that influence bike demand, such as time of day, weather conditions, and special events.
- *Model Development:* Building and training predictive models using machine learning techniques (e.g., regression, time series forecasting) to predict bike counts based on selected features.
- *Model Evaluation:* Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) and validating its accuracy through cross-validation techniques.
  *Technologies Used:*
- Programming Languages: Python (for data analysis and modeling), SQL (for data querying and preprocessing).
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for machine learning), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization).

By accurately predicting bike demand at each hour, this project aims to enhance the efficiency of bike sharing systems in urban cities, ultimately improving mobility comfort and user experience. The insights gained from this project can also inform future strategies for bike fleet management and operational planning.
